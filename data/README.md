# Data

Contains data in CSV format for the experiment


- `data_MTurk_direct.csv` and `data_UNSW_direct.csv` contain the raw data for the direct elicitation task for the MTurk and UNSW samples respectively. (Gender: 1 = male, 2 = female; Other variables should be self-explanatory)

- `data_MTurk_advisor.csv` and `data_UNSW_advisor.csv` contain the results for the advisor tasks. The format of the data is as follows: each column represents one possible question (e.g., "Turnbull" corresponds to the question in which the participant was told that the advisor recommends "Turnbull"), and the number recorded is the participant response to that question: e.g., 1=Brown, 2=Shorten, 3=Howard, 4=Turnbull)
