@article{rosch_structural_1976,
	Abstract = {In a study with 249 Ss, it was hypothesized that the effects associated with degree of typicality in natural semantic categories can be generated as a function of the structure of artificial categories. Three types of category were used: (a) dot patterns, in which typicality was defined as similarity to a prototype pattern in overall configuration; (b) stick figures, in which typicality was defined as closeness to a prototype figure possessing the means of attributes for the category; and (c) letter strings, in which typicality was defined as the degree of family resemblance (overlap of letters) among category members. For all 3 category types, it was found that structural typicality determined ease of item learning, speed of classification of items after learning, ratings of the typicality of items, order in which items were generated in a production task, and facilitation or inhibition of responses to items in a priming paradigm. These typicality effects were obtained both when frequency of items was equated and when rates of learning were equated by inverting the relation between frequency and typicality.

@article{zeigenfuse_general_2010,
	Abstract = {Data from psychological experiments are rife with `contaminants', which can generally be defined as data generated by psychological processes different from those intended as the object of study. Contaminant data can interfere with the testing of substantive psychological models and their parameters, so it is important to have methods for their identification and removal. After noting that current practices in cognitive modeling for dealing with contaminants are not completely satisfactory, we argue for a general latent mixture approach to the problem. We demonstrate the tractability and effectiveness of the approach concretely, through a series of four applications. These applications involve a simple choice problem, a diffusion model of a response time and accuracy in decision-making, a hierarchical signal detection model of recognition memory, and a reinforcement learning model of decision-making on bandit problems. We conclude that developing models of contaminant processes requires the same sort of creative effort that is needed to model substantive psychological processes, but that it is a necessary endeavour that can be coherently and usefully pursued within the latent mixture modeling approach.},
