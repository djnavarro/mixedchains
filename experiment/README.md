# Experiments

There are four files in this folder:

- The `AdviceTaking` files pertain to quasi-iterated task, and the `PriorElictation` files relate to the direct elicitation task.

- There are two formats of the surveys. One version is in Word (`.docx`) format, and the other is a Qualtrics survey format (`.qsf`) file that can be directly imported into qualtrics and should preserve the survey logic etc. Note that the `.qsf` documents are plain text files that follow JSON format.

- The version of the survey files included here is the one presented to participants on Amazon Mechanical Turk. The version used for UNSW students was slightly different: it didn't have the MTurk related instructions and consent form. It also had a question asking if people had seen the questions in a different study (due to the way this study was bundled with other tasks in the UNSW participation pool).
