# Analysis

Code used to generate figures and run the various simulations reported in the paper. Analyses were run using R. Slightly unfortunately, I (Danielle) didn't do the best job of documenting the code as I wrote it (I'm slowly improving my coding practices, but it's a slow process!) I've attempted to provide some explanatory notes in the readme files. Hopefully it is helpful.
