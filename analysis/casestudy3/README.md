# Case Study 3

- There are two scripts here: `sim3_gcmpure.R` runs the GCM simulations for the homogenous chains, and `sim3_gcmmixed.R` runs the simulations for the mixed chains. By default they're set to use the stored data rather than re-run the simulations
- The data from the simulations are stored in `sim3_gcmpure.Rdata` and `sim3_gcmmixed.Rdata`
