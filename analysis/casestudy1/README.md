# Case Study 1

- `sim1_transitions.R` draws the transition matrices associated with the two learner types (strong bias & weak bias)
- `sim1_language1.R` and `sim1_language2.R` are used to run the Beta(2,1) vs Beta(1,10) comparison
- `sim1_extensions.R` is used to produce the MAP vs posterior sampling example
